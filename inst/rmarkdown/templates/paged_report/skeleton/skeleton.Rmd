::: {.lead .text-secondary}

Create stunning **CCCM branded paged** report mixing text, images, tables, plots, code and more, directly with this template.

:::

## Template

The `paged_report` template comes with predefined styles and components. You can modify many aspects directly from the document YAML or by simply using CSS classes, but we recommend you stick with the default options.

#### YAML

The YAML is the header of the document. It contains the metadata of the document and some options to customize the output. We recommend not to add options such as `toc`, `lot` or `lof`, as they might break the content if you don't start with an heading, but feel free to experiment.

The template comes with four specific options:

1. `coord_mec`: choose between "cluster", "sector" or "wg" to define the specif logo of the document. The default is "cluster".
1. `country`: enter the country name to add the text below the logo. The default is `null`.
1. `other_css`: add extra CSS to the document. The default is `null`.
1. `number_sections`: add numbers to the sections. The default is `false`.

## Typography

In this section, we will show the basic usage of the template on how to make CCCM branded Paged document but as the template is using Bootstrap, almost all the functionalities of the framework are available to you but limited to what is relevant to print document.

You can add classes, attributes, and other identifiers to regions of content using Divs and Spans.

For example, here we add the `{.bg-light}` class to a region of content using a div (`:::`):

```{markdown}
::: {.bg-light}
This content will be styled with a light ecru background
:::
```

You can achieve the same at the `span` level with inline styling. For example:

```{markdown}
This is normal text but [this text will be in CCCM blue saphire]{.text-primary}.
```

\newpage

#### Headings

Simply use the `markdown` notation for headings `#` to create your content structure. For example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
#### Heading 3
##### Heading 4
###### Heading 5
######## Heading 6
```

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### [Heading 6]{.mb-5}

#### Inline text

Simply use the `markdown` built-in notation to format your content. For example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
*This line will render as italicized text.*

**This line will render as bold text.**

***This line will render as bold and italic text.***

`This line will render as inline code.`

~~This line will be strikethrough.~~

This line will include a [link to CCCM Cluster webpage](https://www.cccmcluster.org/)
```

*This line will render as italicized text.*

**This line will render as bold text.**

***This line will render as bold and italic text.***

`This line will render as inline code.`

~~This line will be strikethrough.~~

This line will include a [link to CCCM Cluster webpage](https://www.cccmcluster.org/). To have the link directly with the text change the `link-to-footnotes` option to `false` in the YAML.

Not all the formatting can be achieved with `markdown` only, but Rmd understands `HTML` so extra styling can be perfomed by directly entering `HTML` code. For example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
<u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u>
```

<u>This line of text will render as underlined.</u>

The template also includes some `CSS` classes to help with formating. For example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
:::{.lead}
This is a lead paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs.
:::

You can use the mark class to [highlight]{.mark} text.

[This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.]{.small}
```

:::{.lead}
This is a subheading paragraph. It stands out from regular paragraphs, especially with [.text-secondary class]{.text-secondary}.
:::

You can use the mark class to [highlight]{.mark} text.

[This line of text is meant to be treated as fine print.]{.small}

#### Footnotes

Useful for CCCM document you can create **footnotes** with the following code:

```{markdown,  echo=TRUE}
This is a footnote^[Text of the footnote]
```

This is a footnote^[Text of the footnote]

#### Lists

The template comes with stylized lists, simply create them using `markdown` notation. For examples:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
* unordered list
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
        - sub-sub-item 1

1. ordered list
2. item 2
    i) sub-item 1
         A.  sub-sub-item 1
```

* unordered list
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
        - sub-sub-item 1

1. ordered list
2. item 2
    i) sub-item 1
         A.  sub-sub-item 1

#### Blockquote

Blockquote can be achieved with `markdown` using the `>` notation. To include a quote author, add a blank line with the `>` character and a line with the `>` character for the author itself. For example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
> "A simple blockquote"

> "A blockquote with source"
>
> From an important person
```

> A simple blockquote

> A blockquote with source
>
> From an important person

## Colors

Bootstrap comes with an extensive set of color helper classes for [text](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/colors/) and [background](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/background/). Nevertheless, we would recommend, you keep your document as simple as possible and stick to the `{primary}`, `{secondary}` and `{light}` color palettes of bootstrap.

To change the color, simply apply a specific `CSS` class to the desired element. For text and background, it starts with `{.text}` or `{.bg}` followed by the color name in bootstrap like `{-primary}`, `{-secondary}`, `{-warning}` and more.

Keep in mind that not all the text and background will work together and that you might need to tweak the element separately to make sure it is readable.

\newpage

#### Text color

For example, to add some CCCM blue sapphire text to your content use the following code example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
This my body text followed by [CCCM primary]{.text-primary} text.
```

This my body text followed by [CCCM primary]{.text-primary} text.

#### Background color

As mentioned, adding a specific background color works exactly the same way as the text color. The main difference though is that usually background color will be applied on fenced `divs` but all the `CSS` classes work regardless of it's application to a `span` or a `div`.

Just be careful to apply some coloring to the text if the contrast between the text and the background isn't sufficient and be mindful of the potential `padding` and `margin` needed.

For example, to create a light box use the following code example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
::: {.bg-light .p-3}
A light box with dark text and some padding for readability.
:::
```

::: {.bg-light .px-3 .pt-3 .pb-1}
A light box with dark text and some padding for readability.
:::

\newpage

## Images

To include images in your document, simply use the `markdown` notation with the combination of [Bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/images/). For example to get an image that is 80% of the with and centered use the following code example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
![](path/to/image){width=80% .mx-auto .d-block}
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidonne/unhcrdown/master/inst/resources/img/169_pics_landscape.png){width=80% .mx-auto .d-block}

See the layout section for more information on how to play with images and columns.

\newpage 

## Plots

Use the [`{cccmthemes}`](https://github.com/unhcr-dataviz/cccmthemes) package to produce CCCM branded plots directly in the report. For example: 

```{r plot, fig.align = "center", out.width = "90%", warning = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(cccmthemes)

ggplot(
    mtcars,
    aes(x = hp, y = mpg)
) +
    geom_point(color = "#1B657C") +
    labs(
        title = "Simple scatterplot with ggplot",
        subtitle = "This plot shows the default style of theme_cccm()",
        x = "Horsepower (hp)",
        y = "Fuel efficiency (mpg)",
        caption = "Source: mtcars"
    ) +
    cccmthemes::theme_cccm()
```

\newpage

## Tables

Use the `knitr::kable()` function, coupled with Bootstrap classes to insert simple already stylized tables. At a minimum, you need to include the `table` class and set the `format` to `"html"`. For example:

```{r mtcars, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 5),
    caption = "A simple table",
    table.attr = "class=\'table\'",
    format = "html"
)
```

Again using [Bootstrap classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/content/tables/) for tables gives you some simple formatting out of the box. For example:

```{r mtcars-stiped, echo=TRUE}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 5),
    caption = "A striped table",
    table.attr = "class=\'table table-striped\'",
    format = "html"
)
```

## Source code 

To include code, use fenced code blocks with a language specifier. By default the `echo` parameter of code block is set to `false`, turn it to `true` to show the code in the document.

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}

\```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(unhcrthemes)
\```

```

## Layout

By default the content will live within the margins defined for the document, but the [`CCS grid` capabilities of Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/layout/css-grid/) are available to you. For example, to create a two columns layout, use the following code example:

```{markdown, echo=TRUE}
:::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-6}
Content of first column
:::

:::{.g-col-6}
Content of first column
:::

:::
```

:::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-6}
Content of first column
:::

:::{.g-col-6}
Content of first column
:::

:::

Which also works with **images** and the columns don't have to be the same width:

:::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-8}
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nulla lobortis, diam eleifend pellentesque imperdiet, eros lorem lacinia urna, et aliquet felis ipsum id erat. Praesent dapibus vestibulum porta. Pellentesque quis nulla in nisl laoreet convallis ac sit amet magna. Nam auctor vehicula nibh sed ullamcorper. In hac habitasse platea dictumst.
:::

:::{.g-col-4}
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vidonne/unhcrdown/master/inst/resources/img/169_pics_landscape.png){width=100%}
